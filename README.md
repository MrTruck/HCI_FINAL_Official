### Description:

Friendly Farmers is a grocery shopping Web-App that promises to give the best shopping experience and fill the needs of their customers, <br>
but also motivated to achieve UN's Sustainable Development Goal number 12 which is Sustainable Consumption and Production.<br>
We feel as the distributor of goods have a big responsibility in this chain of consumption and production.<br>
And our actions will bring significant impact in contribution of fulfilling SDG no.12.<br>

So how do we solve this problem?<br>
Our grocery app has a feature called the Eco-meter (Patent Pending).<br>
Eco-Meter keeps track of the user's waste in waste-points and eco-points. <br>
The lower the userâ€™s waste points, the more discounts and perks they get. <br>
Based on the user's purchases, the app calculates the waste produced by the user's purchases. <br>
